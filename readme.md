# Hapi-Act

Basic [Hapi JS](http://hapijs.com/) starter application with [React]() front end. Used as a simple starting point for Hapi and React. For a more complete example, checkout [Mullet](https://github.com/lynnaloo/mullet). This differs by separating the API and web front end entirely.

Install the packages with `npm i` and start the server using `npm start`.
